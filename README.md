## Welcome to YingOS

YingOS is Linux like Operating System kernel from scratch.

In 2004, while reading the Linux kernel source code, I used x86 Asm, and C completely wrote from scratch a real time operating system kernel, with interrupt management, paging, kernel thread, and stack management, scheduling, and preemptive multi-task scheduling, and GDB debugging Stub. For my operating system kernel, I wrote keyword, mouse, rs232, VESA driver, and in the x86 platform 32-bit protection mode to run it up.

If you are interested it, you can download a demo from [here](https://github.com/devinwang/yios/files/1169097/floppyts.img.zip), and boot it as a floppy disk in VirtualBox/VMWare/QMENU or any x86 machine.Even If you do NOT want to download it at all, you can run it in your browser [here](http://psychologist-descriptions-26713.bitballoon.com/)

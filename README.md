## Welcome to YingOS

YingOS is Linux like Operating System kernel from scratch.

In 2004, while reading the Linux kernel source code, I used x86 Asm and C wrote a real time operating system kernel, with interrupt management, paging, kernel thread, and stack management, scheduling, and preemptive multi-task scheduling, and GDB debugging stub from scratch. For my operating system kernel, I also wrote keybord, mouse, rs232, VESA drivers, and ran it up on x86 platform in 32-bit protection mode.

If you are interested it, you can download a demo from [here](https://github.com/devinwang/yios/files/1169097/floppyts.img.zip), and boot it as a floppy disk in VirtualBox/VMWare/QMENU or any x86 machine. Even If you do NOT want to download it at all, you can run it in your browser [here](https://yingos.000webhostapp.com/)
